# International diversification works (eventually)(2011)

## Study Overview
This paper examines the diversification benefits from the perspective of local investors across **22 countries** over a 58-year period, from **January 1950 to December 2008**.

## Methodology
The authors compare the returns of two distinct investment strategies:
* **Local Portfolio:** A portfolio consisting of all local stocks within the investor's home country.
* **Global Portfolio:** An equally weighted portfolio across all 22 countries. 
    * Each country represents $1/22 \approx 4.54% of the total portfolio.

## Correlation Dynamics
The study highlights a significant disparity between short-term market movements and long-term investment horizons:

### Short-Term Correlation (The "Crisis" Effect)
* During financial crises (e.g., October 1987), stock markets tend to crash simultaneously.
* In these periods, the correlation between countries jumps to almost **1.0**.
* On a month-to-month basis, the average cross-country correlation is approximately **0.7**.

### Long-Term Correlation (The "Diversification" Effect)
As the time horizon increases, the correlation between different countries falls dramatically:
* **5-Year Horizon:** Average correlation drops to **0.5**.
* **10-Year Horizon:** Correlation ranges between **0.3 and 0.5**.

## The Driver of Returns: Sentiment vs. Fundamentals
The authors explain these results by decomposing returns using the **Price-to-Earnings (P/E)** ratio as a proxy for investor sentiment.



### 1. Short Term: Investor Sentiment
The P/E ratio represents the amount investors are willing to pay for $\$1$ of earnings (e.g., a P/E of 25 means paying $\$25$ for $\$1$ of today's earnings).
* **Behavior:** Over short periods (like 1 month), investors often panic and sell globally, meaning **sentiment** determines short-term correlations.

### 2. Long Term: Economic Fundamentals
Over 10-year periods, P/E ratios are **mean-reverting**; if a market becomes too expensive (high P/E), it eventually cools off.
* **Primary Drivers:** Long-term returns are driven by country-specific factors, including:
    * **GDP Growth**
    * **Local Laws and Regulations**
    * **Demographics**
    * **Innovation**

## Conclusion
While diversification may seem to "disappear" during short-term crises, such as a one-month market crash driven by global panic, it remains a powerful tool for long-term investors. Over a decade, the unique economic fundamentals of each country drive returns, significantly reducing correlations between markets. Diversification protects investors from being fully exposed to a single country’s stagnation. For example, during Japan’s “lost decade” (1990–2010), real returns were roughly -0.2% to -0.5% per year, whereas a globally diversified portfolio would have delivered 5–6% annualized real returns. Similarly, in the U.S. lost decade (2000–2009), marked by the dot-com bubble and the global financial crisis, the S&P 500 returned about -37% after inflation, while a global equal-weight portfolio gained roughly +28% over the same period.
