## Arbitrage Theory of Capital Asset Pricing (1976)

The Arbitrage Theory of Capital Asset Pricing (APT), introduced by Stephen Ross in 1976, states that if markets do not allow arbitrage opportunities, then asset returns must follow a specific linear structure. If two portfolios have the same risks, they must have the same expected return; otherwise, arbitrage would exist.

### Decomposition of Returns

Ross uses a basic probability identity for any random variable:

$$
X = \mathbb{E}[X] + (X - \mathbb{E}[X])
$$

This separates a variable into its expected value and its unexpected component. Applying this to asset returns:

$$
R = \mathbb{E}[R] + (R - \mathbb{E}[R])
$$

Thus, returns consist of:

- **Expected return**: $\mathbb{E}[R]$
- **Unexpected return**: $R - \mathbb{E}[R]$

### Factors and Linear Pricing

APT does not define the specific factors but asserts that they must exist. Using the no‑arbitrage condition, Ross shows that asset prices must follow a linear structure.
