## 📁 Papers Directory

This folder contains subfolders for each research paper included in the project.  
Each paper’s folder includes:

- **the original paper PDF** — stored for reference and citation  
- **notes.md** — my personal analytical notes and reflections on the paper  
- **code file** — an exploratory script that attempts to analyze or replicate key findings  

This structure keeps each paper’s source material, commentary, and computational work organized and easy to navigate.
