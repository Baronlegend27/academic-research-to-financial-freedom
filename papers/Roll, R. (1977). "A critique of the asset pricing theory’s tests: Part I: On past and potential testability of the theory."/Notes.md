# Roll (1977) — Key Ideas

Roll argues that the empirical tests of the CAPM conducted by Sharpe and others are fundamentally inconclusive. The core issue is that the true market portfolio is unobservable.

## 1. The true market portfolio is unobservable
In the CAPM, the market portfolio is defined as:

> “All investable assets in the world held in proportion to their total market value.”

This includes:
- stocks  
- bonds  
- real estate  
- commodities  
- private businesses  
- art and collectibles  
- human capital (the present value of future wages)

Because many of these assets are untradable, illiquid, or impossible to measure, researchers rely on **proxies** such as stock and bond indices. Roll’s central point is:

> Any rejection of the CAPM may reflect a bad market proxy rather than a false theory.

If the proxy is wrong, the test is invalid.

## 2. CAPM is equivalent to the market portfolio being mean–variance efficient
Roll shows that the CAPM is mathematically equivalent to the statement:

> The true market portfolio lies on the mean–variance efficient frontier.

Since the true market portfolio cannot be observed, its efficiency cannot be tested. Therefore, **the CAPM itself is untestable**; only the efficiency of the chosen proxy can be tested.

# Why This Paper Was So Significant

## 1. The debate shifted: from “Does CAPM fail?” to “What exactly are we testing, and with what data?”
After Roll, empirical researchers had to confront deeper methodological questions:
- What portfolio is being used as the market proxy?  
- What assets are omitted?  
- How could those omissions bias the results?  
- Are we testing the model, the proxy, or both?

Empirical papers now had to explicitly acknowledge that they were testing:
1. the CAPM **conditional on a chosen proxy**, and  
2. the **efficiency of that proxy**.

## 2. Researchers had to examine where the proxy lies on the efficient frontier
Roll forced researchers to:
- evaluate whether the proxy portfolio is itself mean–variance efficient  
- use methods that account for measurement error  
- recognize that inefficiency in the proxy does not imply the CAPM is false

This raised the bar for empirical rigor.

## 3. Roll helped push the field beyond single‑beta explanations
His critique contributed to the movement away from:
- single‑factor CAPM tests  
- regressions relying on noisy proxies for the market portfolio  

And toward:
- multifactor models (e.g., Fama–French)  
- estimation techniques that reduce errors‑in‑variables bias  
- recognition that regressions on noisy variables produce unreliable conclusions

As Roll emphasized:

> When you regress returns on a variable you think you are measuring, but it is actually noise, the conclusions are unreliable.
