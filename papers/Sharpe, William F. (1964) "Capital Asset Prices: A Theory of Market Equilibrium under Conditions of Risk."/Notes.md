In **Sharpe (1964)**, the CAPM model is formally developed. Sharpe builds on the earlier work of **Markowitz**, who assumed investors already *knew* the expected returns of assets. However, Markowitz never explained **where** those expected returns come from. This leaves an important unanswered question:

> **Why does Asset A have a higher expected return than Asset B?**  
> More generally: **Why does any stock have the expected return it has?**

Markowitz assumed that investors already knew the expected returns and correlations of assets. He never explained why Asset A should have a higher return than Asset B; he simply showed how to build a portfolio once you had those numbers.

Sharpe addresses this by introducing an **equilibrium assumption**. 

This assumption is somewhat circular, but it works for the time.
1. Everyone observes the same information and reaches the same conclusions about risk and return. So there are no overvalued or undervalued stocks. The market capitalization of a stock is equal to its "true value". 
2. If all investors agree on the optimal portfolio, then everyone will want to hold the **same** portfolio. Which means that no stock is under- or overvalued.
3. That portfolio must be the **market portfolio**, the entire market weighted by value. Otherwise, the portfolio would not lie on the efficient frontier identified by Markowitz.

For the market to be in equilibrium, prices must adjust so that **no investor wants to hold more or less of any stock**. Once this equilibrium is assumed, Sharpe proves that:

- The only risk that matters for expected returns is **systematic (market) risk**, measured by **beta**.
- If a stock adds a lot of market risk but offers a low return, prices must adjust until its expected return compensates for that risk.
- **Idiosyncratic (company‑specific) risk does not affect expected returns**, because it can be diversified away in a large portfolio.

**Main result:**  
Expected returns are **linearly related to beta**, because only systematic risk is priced. Idiosyncratic risk disappears through diversification, so it does not earn a risk premium.
