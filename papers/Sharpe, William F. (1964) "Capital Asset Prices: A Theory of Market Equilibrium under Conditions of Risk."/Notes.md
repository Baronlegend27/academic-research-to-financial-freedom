In **Sharpe (1964)**, the CAPM model is formally developed. Sharpe builds on the earlier work of **Markowitz**, who assumed investors already *knew* the expected returns of assets. However, Markowitz never explained **where** those expected returns come from. This leaves an important unanswered question:

> **Why does Asset A have a higher expected return than Asset B?**  
> More generally: **Why does any stock have the expected return it has?**

Sharpe addresses this by introducing an **equilibrium assumption**. This assumption is somewhat circular, but it works: everyone observes the same information and reaches the same conclusions about risk and return. If all investors agree on the optimal portfolio, then everyone will want to hold the **same** portfolio. That portfolio must be the **market portfolio**—the entire market weighted by value.

For the market to be in equilibrium, prices must adjust so that **no investor wants more or less of any stock**. Once this equilibrium is assumed, Sharpe proves that:

- The only risk that matters for expected returns is **systematic (market) risk**, measured by **beta**.
- If a stock adds a lot of market risk but offers a low return, prices must adjust until its expected return compensates for that risk.
- **Idiosyncratic (company‑specific) risk does not affect expected returns**, because it can be diversified away in a large portfolio.

**Main result:**  
Expected returns are **linearly related to beta**, because only systematic risk is priced. Idiosyncratic risk disappears through diversification, so it does not earn a risk premium.
